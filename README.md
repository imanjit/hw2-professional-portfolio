<b>Objective</b>

Create a responsive profile page displaying a brief introduction about me and my projects to show employers


<b>Process</b>

Since my projects are not completed yet, my task initially was to layout the page and add pictures, styling, contact information and functional links. 


<b>Challenges</b>
The main challenge I faced involved media queries and getting my self portrait to flex ontop of its sibling when the screen was at 768px. I intially used margin to space my picture from its sibling, but ended up using position: relative and bottom: 10px to fix the problem.
