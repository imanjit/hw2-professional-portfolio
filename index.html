        <p>
          My name is Imanjit "Iman" Bains and I am an aspiring web developer in the Seattle area.
          I graduated from the University of Washington Tacoma in 2014 with a double major in Political Economy and Psychology.
          and am currently attending the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp. I have worked in banking and finance 
          for the past 6 years and am now looking to change gears and dive into the world of web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why make this career change? The answer is simple: <i>natural</i>. Coding and web development is something
          that feels natural to me, as I've spent much of my childhood playing with computers and learning the ins and outs of
          the internet while it was still in one of it's earliest stages. Wanting to learn more, I took a web development class
          in high school that I naturally excelled in. I have always felt I had a place in the world of web development, and 
          seeing how much the internet has grown over the years prompted me to make this exciting career change.
